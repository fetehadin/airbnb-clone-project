Airbnb Clone - Backend

üìç Project Overview

üöÄ Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend supports various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

üèÜ Project Goals

User Management: Secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Property Management: Create, update, and retrieve property listings.

Booking System: Mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage bookings.

Payment Processing: Integration with a payment system to handle transactions.

Review System: Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

Data Optimization: Implement indexing and caching for efficient data handling.

üìÖ Feature Breakdown

User Management: Handles account creation, login, profile management, and user roles using secure authentication protocols.

Property Management: Allows hosts to list, update, and delete property listings, while enabling users to browse and filter properties.

Booking System: Facilitates real-time booking of properties with options to manage check-in/check-out.

Payment Processing: Manages booking-related payments and stores payment history securely.

Review System: Lets users post feedback and ratings, enhancing trust and property transparency.

API Integration: RESTful APIs and GraphQL support seamless client-server communication.

ü™ß Technology Stack

Django: Web framework for building scalable backend applications.

Django REST Framework: API toolkit for building RESTful web services.

GraphQL: Query language for APIs enabling flexible data retrieval.

PostgreSQL: Relational database for persistent storage.

Celery: Task queue for managing asynchronous tasks.

Redis: In-memory data store used for caching and session management.

Docker: Containerization tool to ensure consistency across environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.

üë• Team Roles

Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints, business logic, and integrates with external services.

Database Administrator: Designs database schema, ensures data integrity, and applies indexing.

DevOps Engineer: Manages containerization, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems.

QA Engineer: Writes and executes test cases to validate features and improve reliability.

üìà Database Design Overview

Entities and Key Fields:

Users

id, name, email, password_hash, created_at

Relationships: A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

Properties

id, user_id (host), title, location, price

Relationships: Each property belongs to a user; can have many bookings and reviews.

Bookings

id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out

Relationships: Each booking is made by a user for a property.

Payments

id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_date

Relationships: Each payment is associated with a booking.

Reviews

id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment

Relationships: Each review is left by a user for a property.

üõ°Ô∏è API Security

Authentication: JWT-based authentication to securely identify users.

Authorization: Role-based access control to protect resources.

Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse of API by limiting request frequency.

Input Validation & Sanitization: Protects against injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

HTTPS Only: Ensures encrypted communication to protect sensitive data like login credentials and payment info.

Security is essential to protect:

User Data: Personal and authentication info.

Bookings: Timing and location data.

Payments: Financial transactions.

‚öñÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the testing, building, and deployment of code changes.

Why It Matters:

Ensures faster delivery of features, reduces bugs in production, and supports frequent iteration.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions: Automates code testing and deployment upon pushes or pull requests.

Docker: Enables consistent deployment environments across local and production servers.

This project is built with scalability and security in mind to support real-world applications similar to Airbnb.
